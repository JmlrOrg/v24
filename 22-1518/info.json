    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems, i.e., NC-PL minimax problems, whose objective functions satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition with respect to the inner variable. We propose a zeroth-order alternating gradient descent ascent (ZO-AGDA) algorithm and a zeroth-order variance reduced alternating gradient descent ascent (ZO-VRAGDA) algorithm  for solving NC-PL minimax problem under the deterministic and the stochastic setting, respectively. The total number of function value queries to obtain an $\\epsilon$-stationary point of ZO-AGDA and ZO-VRAGDA algorithm for solving NC-PL minimax problem is upper bounded by $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-3})$, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first two zeroth-order algorithms with the iteration complexity gurantee for solving NC-PL minimax problems.",
