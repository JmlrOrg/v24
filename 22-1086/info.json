    "abstract": "We study the ranking of individuals, teams, or objects, based on pairwise comparisons between them, using the Bradley-Terry model.  Estimates of rankings within this model are commonly made using a simple iterative algorithm first introduced by Zermelo almost a century ago.  Here we describe an alternative and similarly simple iteration that provably returns identical results but does so much faster\u2014over a hundred times faster in some cases.  We demonstrate this algorithm with applications to a range of example data sets and derive a number of results regarding its convergence.",
