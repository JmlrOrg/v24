    "abstract": "This paper presents LibMTL, an open-source Python library built on PyTorch, which provides a unified, comprehensive, reproducible, and extensible implementation framework for Multi-Task Learning (MTL). LibMTL considers different settings and approaches in MTL, and it supports a large number of state-of-the-art MTL methods, including 13 optimization strategies and 8 architectures. Moreover, the modular design in LibMTL makes it easy to use and well-extensible, thus users can easily and fast develop new MTL methods, compare with existing MTL methods fairly, or apply MTL algorithms to real-world applications with the support of LibMTL. The source code and detailed documentations of LibMTL are available at https://github.com/median-research-group/LibMTL and https://libmtl.readthedocs.io, respectively.",
