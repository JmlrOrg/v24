    "abstract": "Causal discovery is a methodology for learning causal graphs from data, and LiNGAM is a well-known model for causal discovery. This paper describes an open-source Python package for causal discovery based on LiNGAM. The package implements various LiNGAM methods under different settings like time series cases, multiple-group cases, mixed data cases, and hidden common cause cases, in addition to evaluation of statistical reliability and model assumptions.
