    "abstract": "We present L0Learn: an open-source package for sparse linear regression and classification using $\\ell_0$ regularization. L0Learn implements scalable, approximate algorithms, based on coordinate descent and local combinatorial optimization. The package is built using C++ and has user-friendly R and Python interfaces. L0Learn can address problems with millions of features, achieving competitive run times and statistical performance with state-of-the-art sparse learning packages. L0Learn is available on both CRAN and GitHub.",
