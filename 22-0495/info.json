    "abstract": "Counting and sampling directed acyclic graphs from a Markov equivalence class are fundamental tasks in graphical causal analysis. In this paper we show that these tasks can be performed in polynomial time, solving a long-standing open problem in this area. Our algorithms are effective and easily implementable. As we show in experiments, these breakthroughs make thought-to-be-infeasible strategies in active learning of causal structures and causal effect identification with regard to a Markov equivalence class practically applicable.",
