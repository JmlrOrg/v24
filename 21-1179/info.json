    "abstract": "Many applications such as  recommendation systems or sports tournaments involve pairwise comparisons within a collection of $n$ items, the goal being to aggregate the binary outcomes of the comparisons in order to recover the latent strength and/or  global ranking of the items. In recent years, this problem has received significant interest from a theoretical perspective with a number of methods being proposed, along with associated statistical guarantees under the assumption of a suitable generative model. While these results typically collect the pairwise comparisons as one comparison graph $G$, however in many applications -- such as the outcomes of soccer matches during a tournament -- the nature of pairwise outcomes can evolve with time. Theoretical results for such a dynamic setting are relatively limited compared to the aforementioned static setting.  We study in this paper an extension of the classic BTL (Bradley-Terry-Luce) model for the static setting to our dynamic setup under the assumption that the probabilities of the pairwise outcomes evolve smoothly over the time domain $[0,1]$. Given a sequence of comparison graphs $(G_{t'})_{t' \\in \\mathcal{T}}$ on a regular grid $\\mathcal{T} \\subset [0,1]$, we aim at recovering the latent strengths of the items $w_t^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ at any time $t \\in [0,1]$. To this end, we adapt the Rank Centrality method -- a popular spectral approach for ranking in the static case -- by locally averaging the available data on a suitable neighborhood of $t$. When $(G_{t'})_{t' \\in \\mathcal{T}}$ is a sequence of Erd\u00f6s-Renyi graphs, we provide non-asymptotic $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_{\\infty}$ error bounds for estimating $w_t^*$ which in particular establishes the consistency of this method in terms of $n$, and the grid size $|\\mathcal{T}|$. We also complement our theoretical analysis with experiments on real and synthetic data.",
