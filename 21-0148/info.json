    "abstract": "We consider stochastic bandit problems with $K$ arms, each associated with a distribution supported on a given finite range $[m,M]$. We do not assume that the range $[m,M]$ is known and show that there is a cost for learning this range. Indeed, a new trade-off between distribution-dependent and distribution-free regret bounds arises, which prevents from simultaneously achieving the typical $\\ln T$ and $\\sqrt{T}$ bounds. For instance, a $\\sqrt{T}$ distribution-free regret bound may only be achieved if the distribution-dependent regret bounds are at least of order $\\sqrt{T}$. We exhibit a strategy achieving the rates for regret imposed by the new trade-off.",
